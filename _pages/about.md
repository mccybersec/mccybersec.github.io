Hi everyone! <br>
I'm [Mario Cuomo](https://mariocuomo.github.io) - a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft focused on Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.

This blog will cover these topics in the Microsoft ecosystem by leveraging technologies such as Defender XDR (Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Cloud (and Apps), Defender for Identity and Defender for Office 365), Sentinel and Security Copilot.

The goal is to share how Microsoft's suite of security products can work harmoniously and show the benefits of this holistic approach with tech blog posts.<br>
The idea is to publish a blog post every week, on Sunday.

Thank you,<br>
*Mario*
